</ul>

<h4 class="mb-2">Tips for RECKruitment</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Be yourself! We want to get to know you and why you love Georgia Tech!</li>
    <li>Have fun! The socials and "Get To Know You" events will have fun activities and should not feel like an interview; that's what the interview is for.</li>
    <li>Meet as many members as possible across the socials and "Get To Know You" events. Don't be afraid to ask a member you already know to introduce you to someone new.</li>
    <li>Put time and effort into your application. Follow the suggested word counts for each question to make sure you answer it fully.</li>
    <li>For any Reck Club Reckruitment event, wear something that you feel comfortable and confident in! There are no specifications on dress code for any event, including the interviews. If you would like assistance with clothing, <a href="https://career.gatech.edu/campus-closet-open" target="blank">Georgia Tech's Campus Closet</a> provides this service free of charge to students!</li>
</ul>
